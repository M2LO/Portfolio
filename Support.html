            Back in 2014 I discovered my passion for Electronic Dance Music
            through the former number 1 DJ Hardwell and the rise of Martin
            Garrix. After six years of practicing my skills, in 2020 I gained
            some traction from tutorials I began uploading on my YouTube
            channel. I also got my songs signed on record labels such as
            Hardwell's Revealed Radar, AirwaveMusicTV & more.

            Hello, my name is PLV ! I officially started producing music just
            over a year ago ago but music has always been a big part of my life.
            At some point I couldn't escape my deep passion and just decided to
            take the leap ! I love to let my imagination take my music wherever
            it feels like it, depending on the emotions I'm feeling. You can
            expect a variety of different styles but with the same goal in mind
            - make you escape the reality and give you emotions for a few
            minutes.

            I started the project in 2019 as a hobby, inspired by artists such
            as , & . I started by uploading my tracks to YouTube, getting a few
            hundred views each time, and later the same year on Spotify as well.
            During the Covid-19 pandemic, I took the oppurtunity to spend time
            improving my production, and it definitely paid off. In the later
            half of 2020, I started getting accepted to be released on multiple
            independant labels. After this, I knew that I wanted for Music
            Production to be more than just a hobby.
